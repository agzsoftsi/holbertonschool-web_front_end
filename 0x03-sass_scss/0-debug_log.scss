/* 0. Always debugging! 
 * Write a Sass file that prints Hello world in the debug output.
 * DOCUMENTATION
 * - The @debug directive prints the value of a SassScript expression to the standard error output stream.
 * - The @warn directive prints the value of a SassScript expression to the standard error output stream. It's useful for libraries that need to warn users of deprecations or recovering from minor mixin usage mistakes.
 * - The @error directive throws the value of a SassScript expression as a fatal error, including a nice stack trace. Itâ€™s useful for validating arguments to mixins and functions.
