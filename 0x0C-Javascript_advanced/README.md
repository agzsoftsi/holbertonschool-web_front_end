# TASKs

**0. Lexical scoping and welcome message**

File: [0-welcome.js](0-welcome.js/)

Create a function named welcome:

- It takes two arguments: firstName (string) and lastName (string)
- It contains a variable named fullName, that will contains the firstName followed by a space and then the lastName
- Within the welcome function, write a function named displayFullName:
> - It should display an alert with the message Welcome + the variable fullName + and exclamation mark.
> - Call the function displayFullName at the end of the function welcome

### How to test

- Open your web inspector in the tab “Console”
- Copy paste your code
- Run welcome('Holberton', 'School'); should prompt an alert with this content: Welcome Holberton School!
- alert(fullName), should return a reference error fullName is not defined


**1. Closure Scope Chain mandatory**

File: [1-nested_functions.js](1-nested_functions.js/)

- Create a variable named globalVariable with value Welcome

> - alerts the content of the variable globalVariable
> - creates a variable named course with value Holberton
> - creates a function inner that:
> > - alerts the content of the variable globalVariable and course (concatenated)
> > - creates a variable named exclamation with value !
> > - creates a function inception that alerts the content of the variable globalVariable, course, and exclamation (concatenated)
> > - calls the function inception
> - calls the function inner
- Call the function outer

### Compose the code:

- Write the function inception within inner
- Write the function inner within outer
- Call the function outer in the main code (outside any function)
- Call the function inner within outer
- Call the function inception within inner

### Requirements:
